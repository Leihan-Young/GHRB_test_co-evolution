  "description": "<p dir=\"auto\">Jackson 2.x only escapes minimum set of characters, as defined by JSON specification. This does not include forward slash character ('/'). But while legal, it turns out that more often than not users do want escaping, to guard against potential inclusion-in-HTML problems, particularly for embedded JSON constants in Javascript sources, in script tags.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Now: although it is possible to enable escaping already (via <code class=\"notranslate\">CharacterEscapes</code>), it is bit verbose, and also adds some measurable (not huge, but not completely trivial) overhead.<br>\nSo for 3.0 let's add this character as escape-by-default, but also add a simple mechanism for turning that off if feasible (<code class=\"notranslate\">JsonWriteFeature</code>, most likely?).</p>",
