  "title": "Invert dependency between remoting and common module",
  "description": "<p dir=\"auto\">It is usually understood that the <code class=\"notranslate\">common</code> module is the fundamental dependency for other modules and should not depend on other modules in the project. But in RocketMQ <code class=\"notranslate\">common</code> module depends on <code class=\"notranslate\">remoting</code> module, which looks weird and is an obstacle to the expansion of remoting. So I want to invert the dependency between <code class=\"notranslate\">remoting</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">common</code> module to make <code class=\"notranslate\">common</code> module really common.</p>",
