  "title": "[REQ] Allow mustache templates to support matrix parameters",
  "description": "<h3 dir=\"auto\">Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In a customer project we need to generate server and client side code for APIs containing matrix parameters. Although the parameter style \"matrix\" is available as a variable in mustache, there is no corresponding boolean variable to check for this value (in contrast to <code class=\"notranslate\">isDeepObject</code> for example). Since there is no logic allowed in templates, it is not possible to define a custom template in order to support matrix parameters.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Describe the solution you'd like</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">It would be very helpful if the mustache parameter context would contain a boolean value to check if a certain parameter is a path variable of style \"matrix\", much like it is already possible to check for style \"deepObject\". The changes required to add this value would be very small, I already created a suitable PR.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Describe alternatives you've considered</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">A rather dirty workaround would be to generate java code that does this comparsion during runtime (resulting in code like <code class=\"notranslate\">if (\"matrix\".equals(\"matrix\"))</code>), but this is pretty ugly and does not work generating annotations in server code.</p>",
