  "description": "<h1 dir=\"auto\">Problem solved by the feature</h1>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Hi, I'm relatively new to the project and while going through the unit tests for the JsonWriter class, I noticed something in the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/gson/blob/342d60015ffb2738820d4e49423dbb884533bae8/gson/src/test/java/com/google/gson/stream/JsonWriterTest.java#L966-L974\"><code class=\"notranslate\">testWriterCloseIsIdempotent</code></a> method that I wanted to discuss. This test checks if calling the close method on JsonWriter multiple times doesn't cause any issues, indicating the method is idempotent.
